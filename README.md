Hodrick-Prescott Filter or HP Filter function in R

I have always wondered what this HP filter was actually doing. I prefer the log-quadratic trend though because it is simpler.
I use the AirPassenger data inside R as an example to decompose it into "Trend" and "Cyclical" although it seems that the "cyclical" is  seasonal.

A better example with seasonally adjusted quarterly US Real GDP's cyclical component from HP Filter and Log Quadratic
